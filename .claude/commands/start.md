description: Start IdlerGear session - run context and show project state
---

Run `idlergear context` to show the project vision, current plan, open tasks, and recent notes.

After running the command, summarize:
1. The project vision (what is this project for?)
2. Current plan if any
3. Number of open tasks and their priorities
4. Any open explorations

This gives you the full context to start working effectively.
