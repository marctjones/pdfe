**Steps to Test:**
1. Run the application: \`dotnet run\`
2. Open File → Recent Files menu
3. Verify menu shows recent file paths (should show 7 files)
4. Click on a recent file
5. Verify the file loads correctly

**Expected Behavior:**
- Menu shows list of recent files when opened
- Console shows: \`>>> RecentFilesMenu_SubmenuOpened: RecentFiles.Count = 7\`
- Console shows: \`>>> Added menu item: /path/to/file.pdf\` for each file
- Clicking a file shows: \`>>> LoadRecentFileAsync CALLED with filePath: '/path/to/file.pdf'\`
- Selected file opens in the application

**Steps to Test:**

2. Open a PDF file
3. Press 'R' to enter redaction mode
4. Draw a redaction box by click-and-drag on the PDF
5. Check right sidebar \"Pending Redactions\" panel

**Expected Behavior:**
- Right sidebar shows \"Pending Redactions (1)\"
- Panel displays: page number, preview text, redaction area info
- Drawing more boxes increases the count
- \"×\" button removes a pending redaction
- Backend logs show: \`Redaction marked. Total pending: N\`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ Pending redactions are tracked in \`RedactionWorkflowManager\`
- ✅ Preview text is extracted
- ✅ Pending list displays in UI (needs verification per #2)
- ❌ No \"Apply All\" button

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Add \"Apply All Redactions\" button to UI
   - Location: Bottom of pending redactions panel
   - Enabled only when pending count > 0
2. Create \`ApplyAllRedactionsCommand\` in \`MainWindowViewModel\`
3. Implement \`ApplyAllRedactionsAsync()\` method:

   - Handle errors gracefully (continue on error, log failures)
   - Move successful redactions to applied list
   - Re-render affected pages
4. Add confirmation dialog before applying (optional but recommended)
5. Suggest filename using \`FilenameSuggestionService\`
6. Clear current redaction area after apply

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Create \`WindowSettings.json\` in app data folder
2. Save settings on window close
3. Load and apply settings in \`MainWindow.axaml.cs\` constructor
4. Handle multi-monitor scenarios (window off-screen)
